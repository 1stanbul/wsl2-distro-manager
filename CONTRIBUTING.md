### Code contributions

If you have made a code contribution feel free to open a PR and/or an issue.

### Language contributions

Localizations are saved in `/lib/i18n/` as json files. New languages can be added either directly in the appropriate json file (e.g. `en.json`) or via the localizations [windows/mac application](https://github.com/Flutterando/localization/releases) which provides a GUI.

As of some restrictions with fluent_ui package currently it is easier not to use the country code in the file name so instead of `en_US.json` just `en.json`.

Feel free to publish a PR :)
